## Install from package

Pre-built packages for Windows and macOS can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/casperstorm/ajour/releases) page.

## Install from source

On Ubuntu / Debian derivatives, install the following dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libxft-dev libssl-dev libx11-dev
```

To build:

```sh
cargo run
```

If you want to wrap the executable into a OS-specific app package you can use the following:

```sh
# MacOS
make binary
make app
make dmg

# Windows
cargo build --release
```

## Configuration

You can find a template configuration file with documentation for all available fields [here](./ajour.yml).

Ajour looks for a configuration file in the following locations:

- `$HOME/.config/ajour/ajour.yml`
- `$HOME/.ajour.yml`

On Windows, it looks for a config file in the following locations:

- `%APPDATA%\ajour\ajour.yml`
- `In the same directory as the executable`

**Note**: If no configuration file is found, Ajour creates one by itself at the first location specificed.
