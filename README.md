## FAQ

**_When will you release Ajour / be feature complete?_**

The plan is to have a stable, polished release in time for the Shadowlands launch. 10.27.20.

**_When can we expect a Linux version?_**

Ajour is being developed and tested on macOS and Windows, but should work on Linux if installed from source.

**_What should I do if some addon isn't showing or updating correctly?_**

We encourage you to raise an issue and tell us all about it! We want Ajour to support as many addons as possible. This means a lot of edge cases. A list of addons with known issues can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/casperstorm/ajour/wiki/Addons-with-known-issues).

**_macOS won't let me open the app, what should I do?_**

Instead of double clicking it, right click and choose "Open". That should successfully open Ajour.

**_Why Rust?_**

We wanted to create an application which natively compiles to both Windows, Linux and macOS while at the same time is as performant and reliable as possible.
