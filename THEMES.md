# Themes

Ajour supports custom user generated themes.

To add a new theme, save it as a YAML file. E.g. `example.yml`.

And place it in a folder titled `themes`, in this location:

macOS / Linux:
- `$HOME/.config/ajour/themes`

Windows:
- `%APPDATA%\ajour\themes`

Below are some examples based on popular editor themes.

# [Meh](./resources/themes/meh.yml)
